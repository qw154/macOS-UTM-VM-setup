# macOS-UTM-VM-setup
I successfully ran macOS Big Sur by this set up. I also tried to run Sequoia. It installed very smoothly but I can’t go into the setup.

This is in the emulate mode with JIT, not the virtualize.

# Prepare
1. Download the macOS iso. 
2. The recommended ram is 8 GB ( 4GB for 8 GB ram).

# Guide
1. Add your OS image file and a 100 GB raw disk.
2. Start your VM.
3. When you are in the recovery, select Disk Utility.
4. Find the raw disk and click erase.
5. After it erase, press cmd + Q to quit Disk Utility.
6. Select install macOS and click continue.
7. Click Agreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
8. Choose the disk you erased, click the right bottom.
9. Wait and you are winner!

# Warning
1. If you worry about overheat, use a towel cover an ice block and put it behind the ipad (stupid but cheapest way -_-)
2. It will take a long time, approximately 3 hour for Big Sur.
3. Please let me know if there is any other way to run.
